# Configuration for Convert4Share

# A list of path patterns. If a source file's path contains one of these strings,
# the output will be saved to the `defaultDestDir` instead of the source directory.
excludeStringPatterns: []

# To add more patterns, uncomment and edit the lines below.
# For example:
# excludeStringPatterns:
#   - "Some Cloud/Photos"
#   - "Google Drive/My Pictures"

# The default destination directory for files matching one of the `excludeStringPatterns`.
# Environment variables like $HOMEPATH are supported.
defaultDestDir: "$HOMEPATH/Pictures"

# Hardware accelerator to use for video encoding.
# Supported values: "amd", "nvidia", "none".
# If this key is missing or the file doesn't exist, the application will
# attempt to auto-detect the GPU and create a config file.
# If set to "none" or an unknown value, the software encoder (libx264) will be used.
hardwareAccelerator: "none"

# Video scaling option for ffmpeg.
# The video will be resized to fit within a `maxSize` x `maxSize` square,
# while maintaining the original aspect ratio. For example, a 3000x2000 video
# with maxSize: 1920 will become 1920x1280.
maxSize: 1920

# Number of concurrent workers for image conversion.
# More workers can speed up processing for many images, but uses more CPU.
maxMagickWorkers: 5

# Number of concurrent workers for video conversion.
# It is recommended to keep this at 1 to ensure stability and avoid excessive resource usage.
maxFfmpegWorkers: 1

# Additional custom arguments for ffmpeg.
# These arguments will be added to the ffmpeg command line.
# Example: "-preset slow -crf 23"
# Use with caution, as incorrect arguments can cause conversion to fail.
